                <p>The Debian design process is open to ensure that the system is of the highest quality and that it
                reflects the needs of the user community. By involving others with a wide range of abilities and
                backgrounds, Debian is able to be developed in a modular fashion. [â€¦] Involving others also ensures
                that valuable suggestions for improvement can be incorporated into the distribution during its
                development; thus, a distribution is created based on the needs and wants of the users rather than
                the needs and wants of the constructor.</p>
